# Studying-changes-in-Cognitive-Behavior-using-the-Neuropyschological-tests-using-the-NHANES-survey

In this project, Professor Sungur and I have conducted research on how cognitive functioning patterns change over time for a population using the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).  A total of 1686 individuals completed the series of neuropsychological tests for both years of the NHANES data that would be used to predict the cognitive functioning using several logistic regressions models.
