### Studying-changes-in-Cognitive-Behavior-using-the-Neuropyschological-tests-using-the-NHANES-survey

In this project, Professor Sungur and I have conducted research on how cognitive functioning patterns change over time for a population using the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).  A total of 1686 individuals completed the series of neuropsychological tests for both years of the NHANES data.
Implemented survey-weighted logistic regression models (using training-testing datasets) to analyze the change in Cognitive Patterns using Neuropsychological Tests using (NHANES) data. The three most popular neuropsychological test scores (CERAD, AFT, and DSST) were considered to analyze the effectiveness of predicting the outcomes in cognitive functioning across genders and races over time.
